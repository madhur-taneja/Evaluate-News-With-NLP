## Project Summary
* The goal of this project is to give you a taste of the environment and tools you will most likely come across in a front end role. Your focus should be to understand the role every tool and technology is playing in the overall architecture, but you shouldnâ€™t feel the need to memorize the particular commands, config setups, or structure that we create here. Every company - and even every project - will have its own custom setup, but if you understand the moving pieces you will be able to get the gist of even far more complicated projects than this one.


## What You Will Build
* We will be building web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. Using an exciting new api called [Aylien](https://aylien.com/), we can build a simple web interface to interact with their NLP system.

## Getting Started

1. Download the `.zip` or clone the repository.
2. Install all dependencies using `npm install` command on the terminal.
3. Generate the `dist` folder using `npm run build-prod` command on the terminal
4. Aylien API requires you to sign up and get credentials to use their endpoints. After signing up, you will get an `API-KEY` and `API-ID`. Create an `.env` file that contain those two like this: 
    > API_ID=***  
    API_KEY=***

    Just replace the "***" with your credentials.
5. To start the express server, run `npm run start` command in the terminal. The server will start on http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
6. To build the app in development mode, run `npm run build-dev`. command in the terminal. The server will start on http://localhost:8080/ in your browser which is the default port for webpack dev server.
7. Use `npm run test` command to test the project with jest.
